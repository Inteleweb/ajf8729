ðŸ‘‹ I'm AJ, an IT professional in the Microsoft space for 10+ years. I mostly work with ConfigMgr, Intune, Active Directory, and Azure AD. I'm currently a ConfigMgr Customer Engineer for Microsoft as a vendor. I'm also one of the admins of the [WinAdmins Community](https://winadmins.io/).

Endpoint management, AuthN/AuthZ, and security/infosec all greatly interest me. Ask me about deploying internet-accessible domain controllers!

In my free time, I enjoy learning and helping others on various social media platforms with tech-related stuff, tinkering in my home lab, and writing the occasional technical blog post about stuff I do or find interesting.

Feel free to hit me up at any time if you've got a question or comment about something I've posted or shared, feedback is always welcome! You can find me as `ajf8729` on most platforms.
